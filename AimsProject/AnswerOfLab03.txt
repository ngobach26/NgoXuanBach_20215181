Q: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language
 -  JAVA is always a pass by value programming language

 Q: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
- The swap method only swaps the references of the two DigitalVideoDisc objects passed as parameters, not their actual
contents. Therefore, after the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), the values of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD now
reference swapped objects, but the titles of the respective objects remain the same. This is because the actual values 
stored in memory for the objects themselves were not affected by merely swapping the references.

Q: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
- The parameter jungleDVD is passed in the method as another reference of the actual object and cinderellaDVD.getTitle() passed
the copied String of cinderellaDVD title
- So when you setTitle for jungleDVD the actual content be changed.

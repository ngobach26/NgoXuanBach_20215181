Q1: When should accessor methods be used

Accessor methods should be used in Java when we want to enforce encapsulation and ensure that the internal state of an object is only accessed and modified in a controlled manner.
By using accessor method, we can hide implementation details of the object from other classes, which makes it easier to maintain and modify the code without affecting other parts of the system.
Additionally, accessor methods can be used to add additional functionality such as validation or synchronization, when accessing or modifying the objectâ€™s state

Q2: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

No, In Java, you cannot have two constructor methods with the same number and type of parameters, even if they have different names. This is because the constructor method is called implicitly when an object is created, so the Java compiler needs to know which constructor method to call based on the number and type of arguments passed in.
